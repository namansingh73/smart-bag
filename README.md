# Backend

## Installation

To get the backend setup working locally, you can first of all clone the repository onto your local system using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/namansingh73/smartBag
```

The next step would be installing the required packages from the requirements.txt file.
The correct way to do it would be writing the following command in your Command Line Interface:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Thats it! This should install all the packages required, and now the system is ready to be run.
Run the app.py file as per your convenience:

1. Use ur editor to directly run the file
2. Use the CLI to run the file by going to the correct directory and then executing

```
python app.py
```

The directory containing the file in our case was :

```
C:\Users\schaw\Python files\ChemistryGods\smart-bag> python app.py
```

The server would now be running on your local machine on local port 5000 (the port number can be different). The next step would be to test some API routes, which you can see in the next section of the documentation.
